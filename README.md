<h1 align="center">CodeAstra ~ Modern Code Editor</h1>

CodeAstra is a modern, extensible, and lightweight code editor built using C++ and Qt6, designed to offer a fast, customizable, and feature-rich development experience. Inspired by NeoVim and VSCode, it **will** provide efficient file navigation, syntax highlighting, and a powerful plugin system, making it an ideal choice for developers who need speed, flexibility, and control. With a focus on performance and usability, the editor **will** support split views, an integrated terminal, customizable key bindings, and seamless Git integration, catering to both beginners and power users.
